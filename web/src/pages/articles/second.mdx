import { ArticleLayout } from "../../components/layouts/ArticleLayout";

I **love** using [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/)

```cpp
int a = 10;
int *b = &a
b += 1
```

export default ({ children }) => (
  <ArticleLayout meta={{ title: "Second", description: "real" }}>
    {children}
  </ArticleLayout>
);
